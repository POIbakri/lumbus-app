# Location & Currency Features - Summary

## ‚úÖ Mobile App Changes Complete

I've updated the mobile app with:

### 1. Fixed Price Display Bug ‚úÖ
- **Issue:** Prices were showing as $0.20 instead of $20.00
- **Fix:** Removed incorrect division by 100 in `lib/currency.ts`
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - prices now display correctly

### 2. Location Detection ‚úÖ
- **Created:** `hooks/useLocation.ts` - Hook to detect user's location
- **Features:**
  - Calls `/api/location/detect` endpoint
  - Falls back to US if endpoint doesn't exist
  - Provides country, continent, region info

### 3. Location-Based Plan Sorting ‚úÖ
- **Created:** `lib/plan-sorting.ts` - Plan sorting utilities
- **Features:**
  - Scores plans by relevance to user's location
  - Exact country match = highest priority
  - Continental plans = medium priority
  - Global plans = lower priority
  - Other regions = lowest priority

### 4. Updated Browse Screen ‚úÖ
- **File:** `app/(tabs)/browse.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - Imports location hook and sorting utilities
  - Detects user's location on load
  - Sorts plans by location relevance
  - Shows location indicator: "Showing plans for United States"
  - When searching, disables location sorting (shows all results)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Endpoints Still Needed

The mobile app is ready, but these backend endpoints need to be created:

### 1. GET `/api/location/detect`

**Purpose:** Detect user's location from IP address

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "country_code": "US",
  "country_name": "United States",
  "continent_code": "NA",
  "region": "California",
  "city": "San Francisco"
}
```

**Implementation:** See `CURRENCY_LOCATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for full code

---

### 2. GET `/api/currency/detect`

**Purpose:** Detect user's currency from location

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "country": "US",
  "currency": "USD",
  "symbol": "$",
  "name": "US Dollar"
}
```

**Implementation:** See `CURRENCY_LOCATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for full code

---

### 3. POST `/api/currency/convert`

**Purpose:** Convert USD prices to user's currency

**Request:**
```json
{
  "prices": [1500, 2500, 3500],
  "currency": "GBP"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "prices": [
    {
      "usd": 1500,
      "converted": 1185,
      "formatted": "¬£11.85"
    },
    {
      "usd": 2500,
      "converted": 1975,
      "formatted": "¬£19.75"
    }
  ],
  "rate": 0.79
}
```

**Implementation:** See `CURRENCY_LOCATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for full code

## üì± Current Mobile App Behavior

### With Endpoints Implemented
- ‚úÖ Detects user's location automatically
- ‚úÖ Shows relevant plans first (US plans for US users, EU plans for EU users, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Converts prices to user's currency
- ‚úÖ Displays location: "Showing plans for United States"

### Without Endpoints (Current)
- ‚úÖ Falls back to US location gracefully
- ‚úÖ Shows all plans (no location-based sorting)
- ‚úÖ Displays USD prices
- ‚úÖ App works perfectly, just without location features

---

## üöÄ Testing After Backend Implementation

### Test Location Detection

```bash
# From mobile app console
üìç Detecting location...
üìç Location detected: {country_code: "US", country_name: "United States", ...}
```

### Test Plan Sorting

**Expected behavior:**
1. User in US sees US plans first
2. Then North American plans
3. Then global plans
4. Then other regions

**Example order for US user:**
```
1. USA 5GB 30Days
2. USA 10GB 30Days
3. North America 3GB 30Days
4. Global 5GB 30Days
5. Europe 3GB 30Days
```

### Test Currency Conversion

```bash
# From mobile app console
üíµ Using USD (currency detection unavailable)
# After backend implemented:
üí± Detected currency: GBP
üí± Converting prices...
```

---

## üìã Next Steps

### For Backend Developer

1. **Create the three endpoints:**
   - `GET /api/location/detect`
   - `GET /api/currency/detect`
   - `POST /api/currency/convert`

2. **Full implementation code:** See `CURRENCY_LOCATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

3. **Test endpoints:** Use cURL commands in the guide

4. **Deploy:** Push to production

### For Mobile App Testing

1. **Test without backend endpoints** (current):
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Should show: "üíµ Using USD (currency detection unavailable)"
   # Plans appear in original order
   ```

2. **Test with backend endpoints** (after implementation):
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Should show location detected
   # Plans sorted by relevance
   # Prices in local currency
   ```

---

## üéØ Benefits

Once backend endpoints are implemented:

‚úÖ **Better UX:** Users see relevant plans first
‚úÖ **Local Currency:** Prices in user's currency automatically
‚úÖ **No Configuration:** Works automatically based on location
‚úÖ **Fallback:** If detection fails, defaults to USD/US gracefully

---

## üîß Optional Enhancements

### A. Cache Exchange Rates
Cache exchange rates for 24 hours to reduce API calls:

```typescript
// In backend
const rateCache = new Map<string, {rate: number, timestamp: number}>();

async function getCachedRate(currency: string): Promise<number> {
  const cached = rateCache.get(currency);
  const oneDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;

  if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < oneDay) {
    return cached.rate;
  }

  const rate = await fetchExchangeRate(currency);
  rateCache.set(currency, { rate, timestamp: Date.now() });
  return rate;
}
```

### B. Manual Currency Selection
Allow users to override automatic currency detection:

```typescript
// Add to Account screen
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => setCurrency('GBP')}>
  <Text>Change Currency to GBP</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### C. Plan Grouping by Region
Group plans in sections (instead of flat list):

```
üìç Plans for United States
- USA 5GB 30Days - $15.00
- USA 10GB 30Days - $25.00

üåç Regional & Global Plans
- North America 5GB - $18.00
- Global 10GB - $30.00

üó∫Ô∏è Other Destinations
- Europe 5GB - $20.00
- Asia 5GB - $22.00
```

## üìä API Usage Estimates

### Free Tier Limits

**ipapi.co** (Location Detection):
- Free: 1,000 requests/day
- Estimate: ~300 users/day = 300 requests/day ‚úÖ

**exchangerate-api.com** (Currency Conversion):
- Free: 1,500 requests/month
- Estimate: ~50 requests/day = 1,500/month ‚úÖ
- *Note: Can cache rates for 24h to reduce usage*

### When to Upgrade

Upgrade to paid tiers when:
- **Location:** >1,000 unique users/day
- **Exchange rates:** Use caching to stay under limit indefinitely

**Cost:**
- ipinfo.io: $99/month for 50k requests
- exchangerate-api.com Pro: $9/month for 100k requests

2. `lib/plan-sorting.ts` - Plan sorting by location
3. `CURRENCY_LOCATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Backend implementation guide
4. `LOCATION_CURRENCY_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files ‚úÖ
1. `lib/currency.ts` - Fixed price formatting, improved error handling

## ‚úÖ Summary

### What's Done ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Price display bug fixed
- ‚úÖ Location detection hook created
- ‚úÖ Plan sorting algorithm implemented
- ‚úÖ Browse screen updated with location-based sorting
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallbacks for missing backend endpoints
- ‚úÖ Complete backend implementation guide created

### What's Needed ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend: Create `/api/location/detect` endpoint
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend: Create `/api/currency/detect` endpoint
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend: Create `/api/currency/convert` endpoint

### Ready to Test ‚úÖ
The mobile app is ready! It will work now with USD/default sorting, and automatically upgrade to location-based features once backend endpoints are deployed.

---

## üéâ Result

**Before:**
- Plans shown in random order
- All prices in USD
- No location context

**After (with backend):**
- Plans sorted by relevance to user
- Prices in user's currency
- Shows "Showing plans for [Country]"
- Smart fallbacks if detection fails

**Test it now:**
```bash
npm start
# Open Browse tab
# Should see plans (in default order until backend is ready)
# Prices display correctly in USD
```
