## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Product not found" (E_ITEM_UNAVAILABLE)
**Cause**: IAP product not created for price tier
**Solution**: Check price in cents (e.g., $4.99 = 499), create `com.lumbus.app.esim.tier_499`

### Issue: Receipt validation fails
**Cause**: Missing or wrong Apple Shared Secret
**Solution**: Get secret from App Store Connect ‚Üí App Information, add to backend `.env`

### Issue: User pays but no eSIM
**Cause**: Receipt validation completed but provisioning failed
**Solution**:
- Check backend logs for provisioning errors
- Verify eSIM provider API is accessible
- Retry provisioning manually if needed
- Have support process for this scenario

### Issue: Sandbox receipts fail validation
**Cause**: Backend using production endpoint
**Solution**: Backend should handle status 21007 and retry with sandbox endpoint
