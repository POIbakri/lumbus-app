# Security Improvements Applied

This document summarizes the security enhancements made to the Lumbus mobile app.

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Improvements

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration

**Problem**: API keys were hardcoded in source files, potentially exposing them in version control.

**Solution**: Moved all keys to environment variables.

**Files Created**:
- `app.config.ts` - Main configuration with env variable support
- `lib/config.ts` - Centralized config accessor with validation
- `.env.example` - Template for required environment variables
- Updated `.gitignore` - Ensures `.env` is never committed

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Now uses `config.supabaseUrl` and `config.supabaseAnonKey`
- `lib/api.ts` - Now uses `config.apiUrl`
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Now uses `config.stripePublishableKey`

### 2. Authentication Flow Verification

**Verified**: The app correctly enforces authentication where required.

**Authentication Flow**:
```
App Launch
    ‚Üì
Check Session (index.tsx)
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ Has Session ‚Üí Browse Plans (authenticated)
    ‚îî‚îÄ No Session  ‚Üí Login Screen
```

**Protected Actions**:
- ‚úÖ **Purchase Plans** - Auth check at `app/plan/[id].tsx:34-39`
- ‚úÖ **View Orders** - Protected by Supabase RLS
- ‚úÖ **View Installation** - Protected by Supabase RLS
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard** - Tab only accessible when authenticated

**Public Actions** (No Auth Required):
- ‚úÖ Browse Plans
- ‚úÖ View Plan Details
- ‚úÖ Login/Signup

### 3. No Hardcoded Credentials

**Before**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD - Keys exposed in code
const STRIPE_KEY = 'pk_live_51SIpVD...';
const SUPABASE_KEY = 'eyJhbGciOiJI...';
```

**After**:
```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD - Keys loaded from config
import { config } from '../lib/config';

const stripe = config.stripePublishableKey;
const supabase = createClient(config.supabaseUrl, config.supabaseAnonKey);
```

### 4. Gitignore Protection

Added to `.gitignore`:
```
# local env files
.env
.env*.local
```

This ensures environment files with real credentials are never committed to version control.

## üîê Security Architecture

### Client-Side Security
1. **Keys in Config** - All keys accessed via `lib/config.ts`
2. **Auth Guards** - Purchase flow checks authentication
3. **Session Management** - AsyncStorage with auto-refresh
4. **Input Validation** - React Native built-in validation

### Server-Side Security (Backend)
1. **RLS Policies** - Supabase Row Level Security on all tables
2. **Webhook Verification** - Stripe signature validation
3. **Payment Intent** - Secure server-side payment creation
4. **User Validation** - Backend validates user exists before provisioning

### Network Security
1. **HTTPS Only** - All API calls use HTTPS
2. **Stripe SDK** - Native secure payment handling
3. **Supabase Client** - Encrypted connection to database

## üõ°Ô∏è What Keys Are Safe to Expose?

### ‚úÖ Safe (Client-Side)
These are in the app and are designed to be public:

1. **Supabase Anon Key**
   - Protected by Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Can only access data allowed by RLS policies
   - Cannot bypass authentication

2. **Stripe Publishable Key**
   - Designed for client-side use
   - Can only create payment sessions
   - Cannot capture payments or access sensitive data

3. **API URL**
   - Public endpoint
   - Protected by authentication and RLS

### ‚ùå Never Exposed (Server-Only)
These are ONLY on the backend:

1. **Supabase Service Key** - Full admin access
2. **Stripe Secret Key** - Can process payments
3. **eSIM Access Credentials** - Can provision eSIMs
4. **Database Passwords** - Direct database access
5. **Webhook Secrets** - Verify webhook authenticity

## üìã Authentication Flow Details

### New User Flow
```
1. User browses plans (no auth)
2. User taps "Buy" on plan
3. App checks auth ‚Üí Not logged in
4. App shows: "Please sign in to continue"
5. User redirected to login
6. User signs up with email/password
7. User redirected back to browse
8. User taps "Buy" again
9. Auth check passes
10. Payment Sheet shown
11. Payment processed
12. eSIM provisioned
```

### Existing User Flow
```
1. App launches
2. Session found in AsyncStorage
3. User taken to Browse Plans
4. User can immediately purchase
5. Auth check passes (session valid)
6. Payment Sheet shown
7. Payment processed
```

### Passwordless User Flow (Web Checkout)
```
1. User purchases on website
2. Account created without password
3. User receives "Set up account" email
4. User sets password via email link
5. User can now log in to mobile app
```

## üîç Testing Security

### Manual Testing Checklist

```bash
# 1. Fresh install
npx expo start
# Should redirect to login

# 2. Try to purchase without login
# Navigate to plan detail
# Tap "Buy now"
# Should show "Please sign in to continue"
# Should redirect to login

# 3. Create account
# Sign up with new email
# Should redirect to browse plans

# 4. Purchase with authentication
# Navigate to plan detail
# Tap "Buy now"
# Should show Payment Sheet (authenticated)

# 5. Kill and restart app
# Should stay logged in (session persisted)

# 6. Sign out
# Try to purchase
# Should redirect to login
```
