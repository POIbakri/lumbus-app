# ✅ Currency & Location Integration Complete!

## Summary

The mobile app is now **fully integrated** with your existing backend currency endpoints!

---

## What Was Updated

### 1. Currency Conversion (`lib/currency.ts`) ✅

**Before:** Called non-existent `/api/currency/convert`
**After:** Calls existing `POST /api/currency/detect` with prices array

```typescript
// Now correctly uses your backend endpoint
const response = await fetch(`${config.apiUrl}/currency/detect`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ prices: usdPrices }),
});
```

### 2. Location Detection (`hooks/useLocation.ts`) ✅

**Before:** Called non-existent `/api/location/detect`
**After:** Uses existing `GET /api/currency/detect` (which returns country info)

```typescript
// Uses currency endpoint which also provides country
const response = await fetch(`${config.apiUrl}/currency/detect`);
const { country } = await response.json();
// Maps country to continent and full name
```

### 3. Plan Sorting (`lib/plan-sorting.ts`) ✅

Already created - sorts plans by location relevance:
- Exact country match = highest priority
- Continental plans = medium priority
- Global plans = lower priority

---

## How It Works Now

### On App Launch

1. **Currency Detection** - `useCurrency` hook calls `GET /api/currency/detect`
   ```
   Response: { country: "GB", currency: "GBP", symbol: "£", name: "British Pound" }
   ```

2. **Location Detection** - `useLocation` hook also calls `GET /api/currency/detect`
   ```
   Extracts: country_code = "GB", country_name = "United Kingdom"
   ```

3. **Plans Loaded** - Browse screen fetches plans from `/api/plans`

4. **Prices Converted** - Calls `POST /api/currency/detect` with prices
   ```typescript
   POST /api/currency/detect
   Body: { prices: [16.99, 25.99, 34.99] }
   Response: {
     currency: "GBP",
     prices: [
       { usd: 16.99, converted: 13.42, formatted: "£13.42" }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Plans Sorted** - Plans sorted by location relevance
   ```
   UK user sees:
   1. UK 5GB - £13.42
   2. Europe 40+ areas - £13.42
   3. Global 10GB - £20.50
   4. USA 5GB - £13.42
   ```

## Testing

### Test Currency Detection

```bash
curl https://getlumbus.com/api/currency/detect
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "country": "US",
  "currency": "USD",
  "symbol": "$",
  "name": "US Dollar"
}
```

### Test Price Conversion

```bash
curl -X POST https://getlumbus.com/api/currency/detect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prices": [16.99, 25.99, 34.99]}'
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "currency": "GBP",
  "symbol": "£",
  "name": "British Pound",
  "prices": [
    {
      "usd": 16.99,
      "converted": 13.42,
      "formatted": "£13.42"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Test in Mobile App

```bash
npm start
```

**What to check:**
1. Open Browse tab
2. Look for location indicator: "Showing plans for [Country]"
3. Check prices have correct currency symbol
4. Check console logs for detection success

2. ✅ `hooks/useLocation.ts` - Updated to use `GET /currency/detect`
3. ✅ `app/(tabs)/browse.tsx` - Already using location sorting (no changes needed)

### Optional Enhancements

<Picker
  selectedValue={currency}
  onValueChange={(curr) => setCurrency(curr)}
>
  <Picker.Item label="USD - $" value="USD" />
  <Picker.Item label="GBP - £" value="GBP" />
  <Picker.Item label="EUR - €" value="EUR" />
</Picker>
```

#### B. Show Original + Converted
Display both USD and local currency:

```
Europe 5GB 30 Days
£13.42 (~$16.99)
```

#### C. Plan Categories
Group plans by region in Browse:

```
📍 Plans for United Kingdom
  - Europe 40+ areas 5GB - £13.42
