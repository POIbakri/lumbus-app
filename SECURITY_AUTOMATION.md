# Security Automation Setup ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 🤖 What's Been Set Up

All automated security tools have been configured to keep your app secure long-term with minimal manual effort.

---

## 1️⃣ Dependabot (Automated Dependency Updates)

### What it does:
- **Automatically scans** your dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- **Creates PRs** when updates are available (especially security patches)
- **Groups minor/patch updates** to reduce PR noise
- **Runs weekly** every Monday at 9 AM UTC

### Configuration:
**File:** `.github/dependabot.yml`

### What you'll see:
- Weekly PRs titled: `chore(deps): bump [package-name] from X.Y.Z to X.Y.Z`
- PRs labeled with `dependencies` and `automated`
- Up to 5 PRs at a time (to avoid overwhelming you)

### How to handle Dependabot PRs:
```bash
# 1. Review the PR (Dependabot shows changelog and compatibility info)
# 2. Run tests if you have them
# 3. If it's a security update: merge immediately
# 4. If it's a feature update: review changelog, then merge
# 5. Dependabot auto-rebases if there are conflicts
```

### Example Dependabot PR:
```
Title: chore(deps): bump expo from 54.0.13 to 54.0.14
Labels: dependencies, automated

Bumps expo from 54.0.13 to 54.0.14
- Security fix for XYZ vulnerability
- See changelog: https://github.com/expo/expo/releases/...
```

---

## 2️⃣ NPM Audit Scripts (Manual Security Checks)

### What it does:
- Scans your dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Can auto-fix non-breaking vulnerabilities

### Added scripts to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "audit": "npm audit --audit-level=moderate",
    "audit:fix": "npm audit fix",
    "audit:production": "npm audit --audit-level=high --production"
  }
}
```

### How to use:

**Check for vulnerabilities (monthly recommended):**
```bash
npm run audit
```

**Auto-fix vulnerabilities (safe):**
```bash
npm run audit:fix
```

**Check production dependencies only (before releases):**
```bash
npm run audit:production
```

### Example output:
```
✅ found 0 vulnerabilities

# Or if vulnerabilities are found:
❌ found 3 vulnerabilities (1 moderate, 2 high)
  Run `npm audit fix` to fix 2 of them
  1 vulnerability requires manual review
```

---

## 3️⃣ GitHub Actions CI/CD

### Security Workflow (`security.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Every push to `main` branch
- Every pull request
- Weekly on Mondays at 9 AM UTC
- Manual trigger (GitHub Actions tab → Run workflow)

**What it checks:**
1. **NPM Security Audit** - Scans for vulnerable dependencies
2. **CodeQL Analysis** - Scans your code for security issues (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
3. **Dependency Review** - Reviews new dependencies in PRs for security/license issues

**File:** `.github/workflows/security.yml`

### CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Every push to `main` branch
- Every pull request

**What it checks:**
1. **TypeScript Type Check** - Ensures no type errors
2. **Console Statement Check** - Ensures you're using `logger` instead of `console.log`
3. **Security Audit** - Quick security scan

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### How to view results:
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click **"Actions"** tab
3. See all workflow runs and their results
4. Failed checks will block PR merging (configurable)

---

## 4️⃣ GitHub Secret Scanning (Already Enabled)

### What it does:
- **Automatically scans** your code for exposed secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- **Alerts you** if secrets are found in commits
- **Works on all branches** (even before you push)

### Already enabled:
✅ GitHub enables this automatically for all repos

### What you'll see:
If you accidentally commit a secret:
```
⚠️ Secret detected: Supabase API Key found in commit abc123
Location: .env
Recommendation: Revoke the key immediately and use environment variables
```

---

## 📊 Security Dashboard

### Where to check security status:

1. **GitHub Security Tab:**
   - Go to repo → **Security** tab
   - See: Dependabot alerts, CodeQL findings, secret scanning alerts

2. **GitHub Actions Tab:**
   - Go to repo → **Actions** tab
   - See: CI/security workflow results

3. **Dependabot Tab:**
   - Go to repo → **Security** → **Dependabot alerts**
   - See: All vulnerable dependencies with fix suggestions

---

## 🔔 Notifications

### What you'll be notified about:

**Email notifications for:**
- ✅ New security vulnerabilities detected
- ✅ Dependabot PRs created
- ✅ Workflow failures
- ✅ Secret scanning alerts

**Configure notifications:**
- Go to GitHub Settings → Notifications
- Recommended: Enable email for security alerts

---

## 📋 Maintenance Schedule

### Automated (No action needed):
- ✅ **Weekly:** Dependabot checks for updates (Mondays 9 AM)
- ✅ **Weekly:** Security workflow scans (Mondays 9 AM)
- ✅ **On every commit:** CI checks run automatically

### Manual (Recommended):

**Monthly (15 minutes):**
```bash
# 1. Check for vulnerabilities
npm run audit

# 2. Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run audit:fix

# 3. Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# 4. Review Dependabot PRs and merge
```

**Before each release (30 minutes):**
```bash
# 1. Production security audit
npm run audit:production

# 2. Review all open security issues
# Go to GitHub → Security tab

# 3. Ensure all workflows pass
# Go to GitHub → Actions tab
```

**Quarterly (1 hour):**
- Review security policies
- Update Expo SDK to latest stable
- Review dependency licenses
- Test on latest iOS/Android versions

## 🚨 Handling Security Alerts

### When Dependabot finds a vulnerability:

**1. You'll receive:**
- GitHub notification
- Email alert
- PR with the fix

**2. What to do:**
```bash
# Option A: Merge Dependabot's PR (safest)
# Click "Merge pull request" on GitHub

# Option B: Fix manually
npm audit fix
npm audit fix --force  # If safe fix fails
git add package*.json
git commit -m "fix: resolve security vulnerability in [package]"
git push
```

**3. If no automated fix is available:**
- Check if there's a workaround in Dependabot PR
- Contact package maintainer
- Consider alternative packages
- Add to security exceptions (last resort)

### When CodeQL finds an issue:

**1. You'll see:**
- Failed workflow in Actions tab
- Alert in Security → Code scanning alerts

**2. What to do:**
- Click the alert to see details
- Review the code location
- Follow remediation steps
- Fix the issue and push
- Workflow will re-run automatically

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Dependabot PRs not appearing:
- Check: `.github/dependabot.yml` is in `main` branch
- Wait: Up to 1 week for first run (Monday 9 AM)
- Manual trigger: Go to Insights → Dependency graph → Dependabot → Check for updates

### Workflows not running:
- Check: `.github/workflows/*.yml` files are in `main` branch
- Check: Actions enabled (repo Settings → Actions → Allow all actions)
- Trigger manually: Actions tab → Select workflow → Run workflow

### npm audit showing false positives:
```bash
# Ignore specific vulnerability (use sparingly)
npm audit fix --force

# Or audit production dependencies only
npm run audit:production
```
